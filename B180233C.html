							<h2>Our Faculty</h2>
							<p>The faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT) is a faculty within the Southern University College (Southern UC). It was established on August 12, 2012 after Southern College (SC) was upgraded to Southern UC. The history reaches back to two decades ago, when the Department of Computer Science was first established in 1991, followed by the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2004. These two departments were then integrated and renamed as the School of Engineering and Information Technology (SEIT) in March 2006.</p>

							<p>Software Engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.

							The course will be delivered pedagogically to students by combining concepts, latest information, feasible methods and scientific ways. In doing so, students will learn the essence of software engineering, including the related fields of programming language, mathematics, systems analysis, software design and quality management. Related knowledge will be imparted professionally to students through basic theory, practical projects, and industrial training to enhance studentsâ€™ analytical, programming and software design skills. Besides, the course will train students to express themselves clearly and communicative. Concurrently, students are taught to appreciate technology scientifically. By the end of this course, self-study and self-improvement are enhanced as well. We have faith our graduates are innovative and able to compete internationally in current challenging world toward successful careers.</p>
